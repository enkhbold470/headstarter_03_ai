Fall 2023



Enrolled in 2022


Tops in Transfer ... and More!There's no deadline to apply for the De Anza College Promise! You can still file the FAFSA or California Dream Act Application (CADAA) now!

For information and personal assistance, contact a Promise Counselor in the Office of Outreach at 408.864.8327 or outreach@deanza.edu. 


Here's How to Apply
Here is what you need to know about how to apply, check your benefits AND maintain your eligibility.

Step 1: Submit your FAFSA or CADAA
There’s no deadline, but it’s better to do this as early as you can. Remember to list De Anza College on your application. And remember you need to re-submit every year.

Step 2: Apply for admission
You must apply if you haven’t already been admitted to De Anza. You must be a California resident (or qualify for AB 540 status) AND a first-time college student, in your first or second year, to be eligible for the De Anza College Promise. 

Step 3: Register for at least 12 units
You must remain enrolled in at least 12 units each quarter, except summer, to be considered "full time" and to maintain your eligibility for the De Anza College Promise.*

The Promise award will cover up to 15 units per quarter. You are responsible for the cost of any additional units. (Different conditions may apply to students admitted into the Promise program before spring 2023.)

However, you may also qualify for additional tuition coverage through other financial aid programs, such as the California College Promise Grant fee waiver. When you submit the FAFSA or California Dream Act Application, your financial aid award will list all the aid for which you are eligible.

*Students with a disability accommodation may be able to satisfy the eligibility requirement by taking a minimum of six units. Contact the Disability Support Services office to learn more.

Step 4: Check your Financial Aid award 
Your award will be posted in the Financial Aid section on MyPortal. Depending on your circumstances, you may not see your Promise award – or you may only see a partial award – before you register for classes. You should see a notification about the rest of your award within a few days after you register.

Step 5: Be patient . . .
Depending on your circumstances, we may not be able to process all of your Promise award until the third week of the quarter. At that point, the De Anza College Promise will pay off your fees and you should no longer see a balance due on your student account in MyPortal.

You won’t be dropped from classes for unpaid fees, provided those fees are covered by the De Anza College Promise and you remain enrolled in at least 12 units.* 
If you've already paid your tuition and fees, and you qualify for a Promise award, you should receive a refund by late October. 
 
*Students with a disability accommodation may be able to satisfy the eligibility requirement by taking a minimum of six units. Contact the Disability Support Services office to learn more.

Step 6: Maintain Your Eligibility
Remember that you must

Remain enrolled in at least 12 units each quarter, except summer, and
Maintain at least a 2.0 GPA
 
to remain eligible for the De Anza College Promise.

Students with a disability accommodation may be able to satisfy the eligibility requirement by taking a minimum of six units. Contact the Disability Support Services office to learn more.

A Note About Parking

The Promise award doesn't cover parking permits, so you'll still need to buy your permit if you plan on driving to campus. (However, all parking fees are waived through June 2024.)
Your award does cover the SmartPass fee, which means you can ride free on VTA buses and light rail.
Martha KanterLaunched in 2017
The De Anza College Promise was launched at a special community event held Sept 27, 2017 at the Foothill Sunnyvale Center.

The featured speaker at the event was Martha J. Kanter, former U.S. Undersecretary of Education and former chancellor of the Foothill-De Anza Community College District.
